This is the official repository for NILS: Scaling Robot Policy Learning via Zero-Shot Labeling with Foundation Models. 


We present NILS: Natural language Instruction Labeling for Scalability, a framework to label long-horizon robot demonstrations with natural language instructions. Given a long-horizon demonstration, the framework detects keystates and segments the demonstration into indivudal tasks, while generating language instructions.

## Quickstart
To label your own demonstration videos, use the following command:
```
python annotate.py \
    dataset.data_id=<data id for huggingface> \
    dataset.name=<name of the dataset> \
    GPU_IDS=[0]<List of gpu_ids to use> \
    PROC_PER_GPU=<Number of processes per GPU> \
    embodiment_prompt_grounding_dino="the black robotic gripper" <Embodiment prompt for grounding dino> \
    embodiment_prompt_clipseg=<Embodiment Prompt for ClipSeg>
    
```
This command will use the default settings. The framework can be tuned to specific datasets via configs. We will explain the process in more detail below.





## Framework Usage
This section will describe how you can use and adapt the framework to annotate your own datasets.

### Creating a Dataset

To create a new dataset, create a new torch.utils.data.Dataset class that inherits from `torch.utils.data.Dataset`. The class should have the following attributes:
 + `paths`: A list of paths to the folders containing the data. This will later be used to store the annotations.
 + `name`: The name of the dataset, used for logging.

The `__getitem__` method should return a dictionary with the following keys:
 + `rgb_static`: np.ndarray containing the RGB images.
 + `paths`: Path to the currently processed data.
 + `frame_names`: Original frame indices. Will be used for saving the detected keystates and language annotations.
 + `gripper_actions (optional)`: Binary gripper actions, if available.
 + `keystates (optional)`: Frame indices of keystates, if available.

### Incorporating prior knowledge
To improve the frameworks accuracy, you can incorporate prior knowledge, such as objects in the scene, available tasks or keystates of long-horizon demonstrations.
### Objects
Create a list of objects in format
```text
pot:silver
spoon:yellow
...
```
and specify the path to the file in the configuration file (`object_list`).
By default, the framework will still check for objects in the scene and will not output objects with a high overlap with predefined objects. If you only want to use predefined objects, set `only_predefined_object` to `True` 
### Tasks
Create a list of tasks in format
```text
place pot on stove
...
```
and specify the path to the file in the configuration file (`task_list`).

### Keystates
If you want to load ground truth keystates, adjust the [Dataset](#creating-a-dataset) to return the `keystates` in the dictionary. The framework will then use the keystates to annotate the scene.


### Config
We use Hydra as config manager. The main config file is located in `conf/base.yaml`.

You can control the number keystate heuristics by changing the entries in `keystate_predictor` and `keystate_predictors_for_voting`.

+ `GPU_IDS` What GPUs to use for labeling
+   `PROC_PER_GPU` Number of processes per GPU. Increase depending on your VRAM.
+    `n_splits` The framework currently has memory leaks, which is why we frequently have to reinitalize the framework. This setting divides the dataset into n_splits chunks which are processed in parallel. The number of processes used is `GPU_IDS * PROC_PER_GPU` 
+
